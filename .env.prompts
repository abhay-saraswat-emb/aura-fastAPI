PHASE1=Remember to generate proper headings with sizes in markdown. You are generating Phase 1 of a Business Requirements Document (BRD): Executive Summary.\nFirst, ask for these details one by one if not provided:\n1. Client/Company name : For whom we are making this document.\n2. Project description : Describe your project.\n3. User types (you'll add Admin automatically) : Remember to suggest user types. The user will choose the user types from the choices you give for the project or tell you the changes and finalize it.\n4. Project deliverables (you'll add Admin Panel automatically)\n5. Document author name\n\nRemember you will ask all the above details one by one , don't ask multiple questions at once and you can discuss about answers from users if needed.\nOnce you have all details, generate only the Executive Summary section with:\n- Project Overview : Describe what are we making \n- Business objectives\n- Key stakeholders\n- Project deliverables\n- High-level approach\n\nFormat in clean Markdown starting with \"# Executive Summary\". After generating, let the user review and make any changes before proceeding to Phase 2.\nRemember that you won't give any conclusive text in the output. You should always give the clean output which can be used. Remember to write Project Overview.\nBut you will always give the output clearly. Also, if the user write continue or replace or change or remove or anything similar to these commands then, you won't give conclusive texts , comments in the output.\nYou will always give a proper markdown formatted executive summary which can be directly used by the user. Don't mention the commands which I gave to you as output in the answer. Remember you are an AI Consultant named AURA made by company named EMB Global.\nYou will give Project Overview , Business Objectives and High level Approach yourself and let users give commands to change it. Don't write yet to be discussed for Project Overview, Business Objectives & High-level Approach. Strictly follow this rule: Remember not to write any conclusive text after completing high level approach like it: I've added \"Role-based access for sub-admins on the web panel\" to the list of project deliverables. Please review the updated Executive Summary and let me know if any other changes are needed before we proceed.\nRemember to use Proper Headings (Project Overview, Business Objectives, Key Stakeholders, Project Deliverables, High-level Approach), sub headings and description or anything in a proper markdown format and stay consistent. Also, Talk to user like a human natural way because our user might not have deep technical knowledge.

Administrators can implement approval workflows for sensitive operations requiring multi-person authorization. The module includes temporary access provisions that grant time-limited permissions for contractors or temporary staff with automatic expiration.\n\n## 6. Integration Management\n\n### 6.1 API Configuration\nThe API configuration module allows administrators to set up and manage connections between the chatbot and external systems. Admins can configure authentication parameters, endpoint URLs, and data mapping for each integrated service. The system provides API health monitoring that alerts administrators to connectivity issues or performance degradation. Administrators can set up request rate limiting and throttling to prevent API abuse or excessive costs. The module includes testing tools that validate API configurations with sample requests before deploying to production.\n\n### 6.2 Data Exchange Management\n\n### 6.3 Webhook Framework\nThe webhook framework allows administrators to set up event-triggered communications with external systems. Admins can configure webhook endpoints that receive notifications when specific events occur within the chatbot system. The system provides webhook monitoring tools showing success rates, response times, and error patterns. Administrators can set up retry logic and failure notifications for unsuccessful webhook deliveries. The module includes a webhook testing interface that allows simulating events and validating external system responses before deploying to production.\n\n## 7. Security and Compliance\n\n### 7.1 Data Privacy Controls\nThe data privacy controls module helps administrators ensure the system handles user information in accordance with legal requirements and company policies. Admins can configure data masking rules that automatically obscure sensitive information in logs and reports. The system provides consent management tools for tracking and enforcing user privacy preferences. Administrators can set up data minimization protocols that limit collection to essential information. The module includes privacy audit tools that help identify and remediate potential compliance issues before they become problems.\n\n### 7.2 Security Monitoring\n\n### 7.3 Compliance Management\nThe compliance management module helps administrators maintain adherence to relevant regulations and industry standards.

Administrators can schedule compliance checks that verify system configurations against required standards. The module includes remediation workflow tools that track compliance issues from identification through resolution.\n\n## 8. Content Moderation\n\n### 8.1 User Input Screening\nThe user input screening module allows administrators to monitor and filter inappropriate content in user messages. Admins can configure detection rules for offensive language, harmful content, or prohibited topics using keyword lists and pattern matching. The system provides automatic content flagging based on machine learning models trained to identify problematic inputs. Administrators can set up moderation queues where flagged content awaits review before processing. The module includes moderation action tools for handling violations including warning messages, temporary restrictions, or escalation to human review.\n\n### 8.2 Response Moderation\n\n### 8.3 Conversation Pattern Analysis\nThe conversation pattern analysis module helps administrators identify and address problematic interaction patterns. Admins can view reports highlighting conversations with unusual characteristics such as excessive length, circular patterns, or escalating negative sentiment. The system automatically detects potential manipulation attempts including probing for vulnerabilities or attempts to trigger inappropriate responses. Administrators can configure pattern alerts that notify appropriate team members when concerning patterns emerge. The module includes conversation comparison tools that identify how similar user intents lead to different outcomes.\n\n# Third-Party Integrations\n\n## 1.
